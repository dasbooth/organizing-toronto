Search Continues for Carrie Olson

Friends, relatives, and strangers gathered on Saturday, continuing to search for Carrie Olson, who has been missing for 3 weeks from Davenport, IA. She was last seen on December 28th, getting gas at a 7 11 in Rock Island, IL. Her car was again spotted at this same 7 11 location a few hours later, driven by <a href="http://www.olitrem.com/js/abercrombie-fitch-model-werden-1939.asp" rel="nofollow">abercrombie fitch model werden</a>
  Tim McVay, a friend of Carrie Her car was found later, technically in McVay possession, as he had taken it to the airport and left it while he and his girlfriend visited Las Vegas. Doesn that seem strange? That Carrie would him her car, to leave <a href="http://gardengrove.co.za/nikefree/nikestoresnederland.asp?goedkope=6&amp;hardloopschoenen-nike-free-run-dames/" / rel="nofollow">hardloopschoenen nike free run dames</a>

  Odd.

Hopefully there is a happy ending to this story, but she has been missing for a while. Generally, the longer a person is missing, the less likely they will be found alive, but this isn always the case. Jaycee Dugard was found after 18 years in captivity, and Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Micelle Knight after 10 years. It is probably more likely the exception than the rule, but it important to hold on to hope. Without it, Carrie may never be found. As volunteer searcher Heidi Streger says don just vanish, if it was someone in my family, I would pray everyone would help. family is offering a reward of $1000 for information that leads to her whereabouts. Will this be enough for someone to come forward?
